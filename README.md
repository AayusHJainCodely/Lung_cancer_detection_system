Cancer is one of the most chronic disease that has emerged in the last century.One of the major challenges faced by the medical team in treatment is the timely detection.

Technologies that can identify cancer biomarkers at the molecular level play a crucial role in this early detection, paving the way for personalized and effective treatment plans.

By integrating biological recognition elements with electronic transducers, transistor-based biosensors can provide rapid and accurate detection, which is essential for early diagnosis.

#Detection of CYFRA 21-1
Cytokeratin fragment 21-1,crucial tumor marker to detect whether diagnosis is for small or non-small lung cancer.

In fabrication SiO2 surface modified with APTES SAM and cross-linker glutaraldehyde to facilitate immobilization of anti-CYFRA antibodies. The surface was washed with 0.01× PBS to remove any residue and then treated with BSA to block non-specific adsorption and enhance the sensor’s specificity for CYFRA 21-1.

#Detection of NSE
Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) serves as a vital biomarker in the diagnosis of various cancers, including lung cancer, due to its association with neuronal and neuroendocrine tissues. The NSE detection, using multianalyte FET biosensor.
The SiO2 surface was modified with APTES SAM and cross-linker glutaraldehyde (GA) to facilitate the immobilization of anti-NSE antibodies, followed by washing with 0.01× PBS and blocking with BSA to enhance specificity. Electrical measurements were conducted to detect NSE-specific changes on the gate surface, demonstrating the biosen sor’s sensitivity and accuracy in detecting NSE in both PBS and human serum samples. Another biosensor for the detection of Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE), a biomarker associated with lung cancer, was fabricated using a tailored approach. The fabrication process specifically focused on enhancing the mobility and ultrasensitivity of the organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) device for NSE detection. Silver nanowires (AgNWs) were doped into the organic semiconductor, PEDOT: PSS, to improve electronic mobility and facilitate the ion-electron transfer process crucial for amplifying small NSE signals. The integration of AgNWs-doped OECTs biosensors aimed to recover the ion/electron transport process in sputum samples, enabling the ultrasensitive detection of NSE down to pg/mL levels. The NSE biosensor was designed to be part of a multiplexed, miniaturized

Effect Transistor (FET) design, integrating a semiconducting carbon nanotube (CNT) film with an undulating yttrium oxide (Y2O3) dielectric layer at the biosensing interface. The sensor fabrication involves engineering the undulating Y2O3 layer to create an optimal biosensing surface for probe immobilization, optimizing the CNT-FET biosensor’s performance. With an enlarged gate area, the sensor achieves remarkable sensitivity, detecting CEA at levels as low as 72 ag/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 155 ag/mL in fetal bovine serum (FBS). Another biosensor for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) detection, the CNT-doped transition metal carbide-based organic electrochemical transistor (CM-OECAT). In the fabrication of the CNT-doped transition metal carbide-based organic electrochemical tran sistor (CM-OECAT) for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) detection, meticulous steps were taken to enhance the sensor’s semiconductor performance. This involved incorporating carbon nanotubes into MXene material, followed by de tailed characterization of the morphology through microscopy analysis. The synthesis process included sodium hydroxide etching of transition metal carbides to obtain MX ene with a unique layered structure, and a hydrothermal method to combine CNT with MXene, as confirmed by SEM and electron diffraction analysis.
#Detection of miR-21 [7], [9] MicroRNA-21 (miR-21), a vital lung cancer biomarker, was targeted for detection using a semiconducting silicon nanowire field-effect transistor (SiNW-FET) biosensor array. Fab rication involved optical lithography and anisotropic self-stop etching for cost-effective production of precise silicon nanowires. Through pH sensing experiments, optimal work ing conditions were established, enabling the sensor to detect miR-21 at 1 fM concentra tions with exceptional sensitivity and specificity, crucial for early cancer diagnosis. Another biosensor for the detection of the lung cancer biomarker miR-21 was fabri cated using a nanoflower-shaped MXene-based field-effect transistor (NSMXFETs). The fabrication process involved modifying the electrodes with miR-21 aptamer, confirming specificity through SEM imaging, and ensuring exclusion of interference substances like miR-31. Characterization of the NSMXFETs included SEM imaging to analyze the dis tribution of elements such as Mn, Al, and C on the two-dimensional morphology.
